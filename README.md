# Understanding "if name == 'main'":

Using `"if __name__ == '__main__'"` ensures that certain code blocks only run when the Python script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module in another script. Here's your example with the corrected code:

script1.py:

    print('I want this code to run in any other name!')
    print('I want this code to not run if the name is not \'__main__\' ')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print('This code will not run if it\'s not the \'__main__\' ')

script2.py:

    import script1

    print('This is code for this file')

When you run script2.py, it imports script1, but the code inside the `if __name__ == '__main__'`: block in script1 won't execute because script1 is being imported as a module, not run directly. This demonstrates how you can control which parts of your Python script execute based on how it's being used.
